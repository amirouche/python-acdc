The Universe represented as multiple disk-shaped _slices_ across time, which
passes from left to right

**Science** (from the Latin word _scientia_ , meaning "knowledge")[1] is a
systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of
testable explanations and predictions about the universe.[2][3][4]

The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia
in around 3000 to 1200 BCE.[5][6] Their contributions to mathematics,
astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of
classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations
of events in the physical world based on natural causes.[5][6] After the fall
of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world
deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of
the Middle Ages,[7] but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic
Golden Age.[8] The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic
inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived "natural
philosophy",[7][9] which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution
that began in the 16th century[10] as new ideas and discoveries departed from
previous Greek conceptions and traditions.[11][12][13][14] The scientific
method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until
the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of
science began to take shape;[15][16][17] along with the changing of "natural
philosophy" to "natural science."[18]

Modern science is typically divided into three major branches[19] that consist
of the natural sciences (e.g., biology, chemistry, and physics), which study
nature in the broadest sense; the social sciences (e.g., economics,
psychology, and sociology), which study individuals and societies;[20][21] and
the formal sciences (e.g., logic, mathematics, and theoretical computer
science), which deal with symbols governed by rules.[22][23] There is
disagreement,[24][25][26] however, on whether the formal sciences actually
constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence.[27][25]
Disciplines that use existing scientific knowledge for practical purposes,
such as engineering and medicine, are described as applied
sciences.[28][29][30][31][32]

New knowledge in science is advanced by research from scientists who are
motivated by curiosity about the world and a desire to solve problems.[33][34]
Contemporary scientific research is highly collaborative and is usually done
by teams in academic and research institutions,[35] government agencies, and
companies.[36][37] The practical impact of their work has led to the emergence
of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by
prioritizing the development of commercial products, armaments, health care,
public infrastructure, and environmental protection.

## History

Further information: History of science

Science in a broad sense existed before the modern era and in many historical
civilizations.[38] Modern science is distinct in its approach and successful
in its results, so it now defines what science is in the strictest sense of
the term.[3][5][39] Science in its original sense was a word for a type of
knowledge, rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge.
In particular, it was the type of knowledge that people can communicate to
each other and share. For example, knowledge about the working of natural
things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of
complex abstract thought. This is shown by the construction of complex
calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, public works at a
national scale, such as those which harnessed the floodplain of the Yangtse
with reservoirs,[40] dams, and dikes, and buildings such as the Pyramids.
However, no consistent conscious distinction was made between knowledge of
such things, which are true in every community, and other types of communal
knowledge, such as mythologies and legal systems. Metallurgy was known in
prehistory, and the Vinča culture was the earliest known producer of bronze-
like alloys. It is thought that early experimentation with heating and mixing
of substances over time developed into alchemy.

### Earliest roots

centuries BCE, found in the royal palace in Mari, Syria

The earliest roots of science can be traced to Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia
in around 3000 to 1200 BCE.[5] Although the words and concepts of "science"
and "nature" were not part of the conceptual landscape at the time, the
ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians made contributions that would later find a
place in Greek and medieval science: mathematics, astronomy, and
medicine.[41][5] Starting in around 3000 BCE, the ancient Egyptians developed
a numbering system that was decimal in character and had orientated their
knowledge of geometry to solving practical problems such as those of surveyors
and builders.[5] They even developed an official calendar that contained
twelve months, thirty days each, and five days at the end of the year.[5]
Based on the  medical papyri written in the 2500-1200 BCE, the ancient
Egyptians believed that disease was mainly caused by the invasion of bodies by
evil forces or spirits. Thus, in addition to drug treatments, healing
therapies would involve prayer, incantation, and ritual.[5]

The ancient Mesopotamians used knowledge about the properties of various
natural chemicals for manufacturing pottery, faience, glass, soap, metals,
lime plaster, and waterproofing;[42] they also studied animal physiology,
anatomy, and behavior for divinatory purposes[42] and made extensive records
of the movements of astronomical objects for their study of astrology.[43] The
Mesopotamians had intense interest in medicine[42] and the earliest medical
prescriptions appear in Sumerian during the Third Dynasty of Ur (c. 2112 BCE –
c. 2004 BCE).[44] Nonetheless, the Mesopotamians seem to have had little
interest in gathering information about the natural world for the mere sake of
gathering information[42] and mainly only studied scientific subjects which
had obvious practical applications or immediate relevance to their religious
system.[42]

### Classical antiquity

Further information: History of science in classical antiquity and Nature
(philosophy)

In classical antiquity, there is no real ancient analog of a modern scientist.
Instead, well-educated, usually upper-class, and almost universally male
individuals performed various investigations into nature whenever they could
afford the time.[45]Before the invention or discovery of the concept of
"nature" (ancient Greek _phusis_ ) by the Pre-Socratic philosophers, the same
words tend to be used to describe the _natural_ "way" in which a plant
grows,[46] and the "way" in which, for example, one tribe worships a
particular god. For this reason, it is claimed these men were the first
philosophers in the strict sense, and also the first people to clearly
distinguish "nature" and "convention."[47]:209 Natural philosophy, the
precursor of natural science, was thereby distinguished as the knowledge of
nature and things which are true for every community, and the name of the
specialized pursuit of such knowledge was _philosophy_ – the realm of the
first philosopher-physicists. They were mainly speculators or theorists,
particularly interested in astronomy. In contrast, trying to use knowledge of
nature to imitate nature (artifice or technology, Greek _technē_ ) was seen by
classical scientists as a more appropriate interest for artisans of lower
social class.[48]

The universe as conceived of by Aristotle and Ptolemy from Peter Apian's 1524
work Cosmographia. The earth is composed of four elements: Earth, Water, Fire
and Air. The earth does not move or rotate. It is surrounded by concentric
spheres containing the planets, the sun, the stars, and heaven.[49]

The early Greek philosophers of the Milesian school, which was founded by
Thales of Miletus and later continued by his successors Anaximander and
Anaximenes, were the first to attempt to explain natural phenomena without
relying on the supernatural.[50] The Pythagoreans developed a complex number
philosophy[51]:467–68 and contributed significantly to the development of
mathematical science.[51]:465 The theory of atoms was developed by the Greek
philosopher Leucippus and his student Democritus.[52][53] The Greek doctor
Hippocrates established the tradition of systematic medical science[54][55]
and is known as "The Father of Medicine".[56]

A turning point in the history of early philosophical science was Socrates'
example of applying philosophy to the study of human matters, including human
nature, the nature of political communities, and human knowledge itself. The
Socratic method as documented by Plato's dialogues is a dialectic method of
hypothesis elimination: better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying
and eliminating those that lead to contradictions. This was a reaction to the
Sophist emphasis on rhetoric. The Socratic method searches for general,
commonly held truths that shape beliefs and scrutinizes them to determine
their consistency with other beliefs.[57] Socrates criticized the older type
of study of physics as too purely speculative and lacking in self-criticism.
Socrates was later, in the words of his _Apology_ , accused of corrupting the
youth of Athens because he did "not believe in the gods the state believes in,
but in other new spiritual beings". Socrates refuted these claims,[58] but was
sentenced to death.[59]:30e

Aristotle later created a systematic programme of teleological philosophy:
Motion and change is described as the actualization of potentials already in
things, according to what types of things they are. In his physics, the Sun
goes around the Earth, and many things have it as part of their nature that
they are for humans. Each thing has a formal cause, a final cause, and a role
in a cosmic order with an unmoved mover. The Socratics also insisted that
philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way
to live for a human being (a study Aristotle divided into ethics and political
philosophy). Aristotle maintained that man knows a thing scientifically "when
he possesses a conviction arrived at in a certain way, and when the first
principles on which that conviction rests are known to him with
certainty".[60]

The Greek astronomer Aristarchus of Samos (310–230 BCE) was the first to
propose a heliocentric model of the universe, with the Sun at the center and
all the planets orbiting it.[61] Aristarchus's model was widely rejected
because it was believed to violate the laws of physics.[61] The inventor and
mathematician Archimedes of Syracuse made major contributions to the
beginnings of calculus[62] and has sometimes been credited as its
inventor,[62] although his proto-calculus lacked several defining
features.[62] Pliny the Elder was a Roman writer and polymath, who wrote the
seminal encyclopedia _Natural History_ ,[63][64][65] dealing with history,
geography, medicine, astronomy, earth science, botany, and zoology.[63] Other
scientists or proto-scientists in Antiquity were Theophrastus, Euclid,
Herophilos, Hipparchus, Ptolemy, and Galen.

### Medieval science

and European science in the Middle Ages

Because of the collapse of the Western Roman Empire due to the Migration
Period an intellectual decline took place in the western part of Europe in the
400s. In contrast, the Byzantine Empire resisted the attacks from invaders,
and preserved and improved upon the learning. John Philoponus, a Byzantine
scholar in the 500s, questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics, noting its
flaws.[67]:pp.307, 311, 363, 402 John Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian
principles of physics served as an inspiration to medieval scholars as well as
to Galileo Galilei who ten centuries later, during the Scientific Revolution,
extensively cited Philoponus in his works while making the case for why
Aristotelian physics was flawed.[67][68]

During late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, the Aristotelian approach to
inquiries on natural phenomena was used. Aristotle's four causes prescribed
that the question "why" should be answered in four ways in order to explain
things scientifically.[69] Some ancient knowledge was lost, or in some cases
kept in obscurity, during the fall of the Western Roman Empire and periodic
political struggles. However, the general fields of science (or "natural
philosophy" as it was called) and much of the general knowledge from the
ancient world remained preserved through the works of the early Latin
encyclopedists like Isidore of Seville.[70] However, Aristotle's original
texts were eventually lost in Western Europe, and only one text by Plato was
widely known, the _Timaeus_ , which was the only Platonic dialogue, and one of
the few original works of classical natural philosophy, available to Latin
readers in the early Middle Ages. Another original work that gained influence
in this period was Ptolemy's _Almagest_ , which contains a geocentric
description of the solar system.

During late antiquity, in the Byzantine empire many Greek classical texts were
preserved. Many Syriac translations were done by groups such as the Nestorians
and Monophysites.[71] They played a role when they translated Greek classical
texts into Arabic under the Caliphate, during which many types of classical
learning were preserved and in some cases improved upon.[71][lower-alpha 1] In
addition, the neighboring Sassanid Empire established the medical Academy of
Gondeshapur where Greek, Syriac, and Persian physicians established the most
important medical center of the ancient world during the 6th and 7th
centuries.[72]

The House of Wisdom was established in Abbasid-era Baghdad, Iraq,[73] where
the Islamic study of Aristotelianism flourished. Al-Kindi (801–873) was the
first of the Muslim Peripatetic philosophers, and is known for his efforts to
introduce Greek and Hellenistic philosophy to the Arab world.[74] The Islamic
Golden Age flourished from this time until the Mongol invasions of the 13th
century. Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen), as well as his predecessor Ibn Sahl, was
familiar with Ptolemy's _Optics_ , and used experiments as a means to gain
knowledge.[lower-alpha 2][75][76]:463–65 Alhazen disproved Ptolemy's theory of
vision,[77] but did not make any corresponding changes to Aristotle's
metaphysics. Furthermore, doctors and alchemists such as the Persians Avicenna
and Al-Razi also greatly developed the science of Medicine with the former
writing the Canon of Medicine, a medical encyclopedia used until the 18th
century and the latter discovering multiple compounds like alcohol. Avicenna's
canon is considered to be one of the most important publications in medicine
and they both contributed significantly to the practice of experimental
medicine, using clinical trials and experiments to back their claims.[78]

In Classical antiquity, Greek and Roman taboos had meant that dissection was
usually banned in ancient times, but in Middle Ages it changed: medical
teachers and students at Bologna began to open human bodies, and Mondino de
Luzzi (c. 1275–1326) produced the ﬁrst known anatomy textbook based on human
dissection.[79][80]

By the eleventh century, most of Europe had become Christian; stronger
monarchies emerged; borders were restored; technological developments and
agricultural innovations were made which increased the food supply and
population. In addition, classical Greek texts started to be translated from
Arabic and Greek into Latin, giving a higher level of scientific discussion in
Western Europe.[7]

By 1088, the first university in Europe (the University of Bologna) had
emerged from its clerical beginnings. Demand for Latin translations grew (for
example, from the Toledo School of Translators); western Europeans began
collecting texts written not only in Latin, but also Latin translations from
Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew. Manuscript copies of Alhazen's _Book of Optics_
also propagated across Europe before 1240,[81]:Intro. p. xx as evidenced by
its incorporation into Vitello's _Perspectiva_. Avicenna's Canon was
translated into Latin.[82] In particular, the texts of Aristotle,
Ptolemy,[lower-alpha 3] and Euclid, preserved in the Houses of Wisdom and also
in the Byzantine Empire,[83] were sought amongst Catholic scholars. The influx
of ancient texts caused the Renaissance of the 12th century and the
flourishing of a synthesis of Catholicism and Aristotelianism known as
Scholasticism in western Europe, which became a new geographic center of
science. An _experiment_ in this period would be understood as a careful
process of observing, describing, and classifying.[84] One prominent scientist
in this era was Roger Bacon. Scholasticism had a strong focus on revelation
and dialectic reasoning, and gradually fell out of favour over the next
centuries, as alchemy's focus on experiments that include direct observation
and meticulous documentation slowly increased in importance.

### Renaissance and early modern science

Further information: Scientific Revolution

Astronomy became more accurate after Tycho Brahe devised his scientific
instruments for measuring angles between two celestial bodies, before the
invention of the telescope. Brahe's observations were the basis for Kepler's
laws.

New developments in optics played a role in the inception of the Renaissance,
both by challenging long-held metaphysical ideas on perception, as well as by
contributing to the improvement and development of technology such as the
camera obscura and the telescope. Before what we now know as the Renaissance
started, Roger Bacon, Vitello, and John Peckham each built up a scholastic
ontology upon a causal chain beginning with sensation, perception, and finally
apperception of the individual and universal forms of Aristotle.[85] A model
of vision later known as perspectivism was exploited and studied by the
artists of the Renaissance. This theory uses only three of Aristotle's four
causes: formal, material, and final.[86]

In the sixteenth century, Copernicus formulated a heliocentric model of the
solar system unlike the geocentric model of Ptolemy's _Almagest_. This was
based on a theorem that the orbital periods of the planets are longer as their
orbs are farther from the centre of motion, which he found not to agree with
Ptolemy's model.[87]

Kepler and others challenged the notion that the only function of the eye is
perception, and shifted the main focus in optics from the eye to the
propagation of light.[86][88]:102 Kepler modelled the eye as a water-filled
glass sphere with an aperture in front of it to model the entrance pupil. He
found that all the light from a single point of the scene was imaged at a
single point at the back of the glass sphere. The optical chain ends on the
retina at the back of the eye.[lower-alpha 4] Kepler is best known, however,
for improving Copernicus' heliocentric model through the discovery of Kepler's
laws of planetary motion. Kepler did not reject Aristotelian metaphysics and
described his work as a search for the Harmony of the Spheres.

Galileo made innovative use of experiment and mathematics. However, he became
persecuted after Pope Urban VIII blessed Galileo to write about the Copernican
system. Galileo had used arguments from the Pope and put them in the voice of
the simpleton in the work "Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems",
which greatly offended Urban VIII.[89]

In Northern Europe, the new technology of the printing press was widely used
to publish many arguments, including some that disagreed widely with
contemporary ideas of nature. René Descartes and Francis Bacon published
philosophical arguments in favor of a new type of non-Aristotelian science.
Descartes emphasized individual thought and argued that mathematics rather
than geometry should be used in order to study nature. Bacon emphasized the
importance of experiment over contemplation. Bacon further questioned the
Aristotelian concepts of formal cause and final cause, and promoted the idea
that science should study the laws of "simple" natures, such as heat, rather
than assuming that there is any specific nature, or "formal cause", of each
complex type of thing. This new science began to see itself as describing
"laws of nature". This updated approach to studies in nature was seen as
mechanistic. Bacon also argued that science should aim for the first time at
practical inventions for the improvement of all human life.

### Age of Enlightenment

Further information: Age of Enlightenment

Isaac Newton's copy of Principia from 1687. Newton made seminal contributions
to classical mechanics, gravity, and optics. Newton also shares credit with
Gottfried Leibniz for the development of calculus.

As a precursor to the Age of Enlightenment, Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm
Leibniz succeeded in developing a new physics, now referred to as classical
mechanics, which could be confirmed by experiment and explained using
mathematics (Newton (1687), _Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica_ ).
Leibniz also incorporated terms from Aristotelian physics, but now being used
in a new non-teleological way, for example, "energy" and "potential" (modern
versions of Aristotelian " _energeia_ and _potentia_"). This implied a shift
in the view of objects: Where Aristotle had noted that objects have certain
innate goals that can be actualized, objects were now regarded as devoid of
innate goals. In the style of Francis Bacon, Leibniz assumed that different
types of things all work according to the same general laws of nature, with no
special formal or final causes for each type of thing.[90] It is during this
period that the word "science" gradually became more commonly used to refer to
a _type of pursuit_ of a type of knowledge, especially knowledge of nature –
coming close in meaning to the old term "natural philosophy."

During this time, the declared purpose and value of science became producing
wealth and inventions that would improve human lives, in the materialistic
sense of having more food, clothing, and other things. In Bacon's words, "the
real and legitimate goal of sciences is the endowment of human life with new
inventions and riches", and he discouraged scientists from pursuing intangible
philosophical or spiritual ideas, which he believed contributed little to
human happiness beyond "the fume of subtle, sublime, or pleasing
speculation".[91]

Science during the Enlightenment was dominated by scientific societies[92] and
academies, which had largely replaced universities as centres of scientific
research and development. Societies and academies were also the backbones of
the maturation of the scientific profession. Another important development was
the popularization of science among an increasingly literate population.
Philosophes introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably
through the _Encyclopédie_ and the popularization of Newtonianism by Voltaire
as well as by Émilie du Châtelet, the French translator of Newton's
_Principia_.

Some historians have marked the 18th century as a drab period in the history
of science;[93] however, the century saw significant advancements in the
practice of medicine, mathematics, and physics; the development of biological
taxonomy; a new understanding of magnetism and electricity; and the maturation
of chemistry as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern
chemistry.

Enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors –
Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally – as the guides and guarantors of their
applications of the singular concept of nature and natural law to every
physical and social field of the day. In this respect, the lessons of history
and the social structures built upon it could be discarded.[94]

Ideas on human nature, society, and economics also evolved during the
Enlightenment. Hume and other Scottish Enlightenment thinkers developed a
"science of man",[95] which was expressed historically in works by authors
including James Burnett, Adam Ferguson, John Millar and William Robertson, all
of whom merged a scientific study of how humans behaved in ancient and
primitive cultures with a strong awareness of the determining forces of
modernity. Modern sociology largely originated from this movement.[96] In
1776, Adam Smith published _The Wealth of Nations_ , which is often considered
the first work on modern economics.[97]

### 19th century

The first diagram of an evolutionary tree made by Charles Darwin in 1837,
which eventually led to his most famous work, On the Origin of Species, in
1859.

The nineteenth century is a particularly important period in the history of
science since during this era many distinguishing characteristics of
contemporary modern science began to take shape such as: transformation of the
life and physical sciences, frequent use of precision instruments, emergence
of terms like "biologist", "physicist", "scientist"; slowly moving away from
antiquated labels like "natural philosophy" and "natural history", increased
professionalization of those studying nature lead to reduction in amateur
naturalists, scientists gained cultural authority over many dimensions of
society, economic expansion and industrialization of numerous countries,
thriving of popular science writings and emergence of science journals.[17]

Early in the 19th century, John Dalton suggested the modern atomic theory,
based on Democritus's original idea of indivisible particles called _atoms_.

Both John Herschel and William Whewell systematized methodology: the latter
coined the term scientist.[98]

During the mid-19th century, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace
independently proposed the theory of evolution by natural selection in 1858,
which explained how different plants and animals originated and evolved. Their
theory was set out in detail in Darwin's book _On the Origin of Species_ ,
which was published in 1859.[99] Separately, Gregor Mendel presented his
paper, " _Versuche über Pflanzenhybriden_ " ("Experiments on Plant
Hybridization"), in 1865,[100] which outlined the principles of biological
inheritance, serving as the basis for modern genetics.[101]

The laws of conservation of energy, conservation of momentum and conservation
of mass suggested a highly stable universe where there could be little loss of
resources. With the advent of the steam engine and the industrial revolution,
there was, however, an increased understanding that all forms of energy as
defined in physics were not equally useful: they did not have the same energy
quality. This realization led to the development of the laws of
thermodynamics, in which the free energy of the universe is seen as constantly
declining: the entropy of a closed universe increases over time.

The electromagnetic theory was also established in the 19th century by the
works of Hans Christian Ørsted, André-Marie Ampère, Michael Faraday, James
Clerk Maxwell, Oliver Heaviside, and Heinrich Hertz. The new theory raised
questions that could not easily be answered using Newton's framework. The
phenomena that would allow the deconstruction of the atom were discovered in
the last decade of the 19th century: the discovery of X-rays inspired the
discovery of radioactivity. In the next year came the discovery of the first
subatomic particle, the electron.

During the late 19th century, psychology emerged as a separate discipline from
philosophy when Wilhelm Wundt founded the first laboratory for psychological
research in 1879.[102]

### 20th century

The DNA double helix is a molecule that encodes the genetic instructions used
in the development and functioning of all known living organisms and many
viruses.

Albert Einstein's theory of relativity and the development of quantum
mechanics led to the replacement of classical mechanics with a new physics
which contains two parts that describe different types of events in nature.

In the first half of the century, the development of antibiotics and
artificial fertilizers made global human population growth possible. At the
same time, the structure of the atom and its nucleus was discovered, leading
to the release of "atomic energy" (nuclear power). In addition, the extensive
use of technological innovation stimulated by the wars of this century led to
revolutions in transportation (automobiles and aircraft), the development of
ICBMs, a space race, and a nuclear arms race.

Evolution became a unified theory in the early 20th-century when the modern
synthesis reconciled Darwinian evolution with classical genetics.[103] The
molecular structure of DNA was discovered by James Watson and Francis Crick in
1953.

The discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964 led to a
rejection of the Steady State theory of the universe in favor of the Big Bang
theory of Georges Lemaître.

The development of spaceflight in the second half of the century allowed the
first astronomical measurements done on or near other objects in space,
including six manned landings on the Moon. Space telescopes lead to numerous
discoveries in astronomy and cosmology.

Widespread use of integrated circuits in the last quarter of the 20th century
combined with communications satellites led to a revolution in information
technology and the rise of the global internet and mobile computing, including
smartphones. The need for mass systematization of long, intertwined causal
chains and large amounts of data led to the rise of the fields of systems
theory and computer-assisted scientific modelling, which are partly based on
the Aristotelian paradigm.[104]

Harmful environmental issues such as ozone depletion, acidification,
eutrophication and climate change came to the public's attention in the same
period, and caused the onset of environmental science and environmental
technology.

### 21st century

The Human Genome Project was completed in 2003, determining the sequence of
nucleotide base pairs that make up human DNA, and identifying and mapping all
of the genes of the human genome.[105] Induced pluripotent stem cells were
developed in 2006, a technology allowing adult cells to be transformed into
stem cells capable of giving rise to any cell type found in the body,
potentially of huge importance to the field of regenerative medicine.[106]

With the discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012, the last particle predicted by
the Standard Model of particle physics was found. In 2015, gravitational
waves, predicted by general relativity a century before, were first
observed.[107][108]

## Branches of science

Further information: Branches of science

The scale of the Universe mapped to branches of science and showing how one
system is built atop the next through the hierarchy of the sciences

Modern science is commonly divided into three major branches: natural science,
social science, and formal science.[19] Each of these branches comprises
various specialized yet overlapping scientific disciplines that often possess
their own nomenclature and expertise.[109] Both natural and social sciences
are empirical sciences,[110] as their knowledge is based on empirical
observations and is capable of being tested for its validity by other
researchers working under the same conditions.[111]

There are also closely related disciplines that use science, such as
engineering and medicine, which are sometimes described as applied sciences.
The relationships between the branches of science are summarized by the
following table.

| Science  
---|---  
Empirical sciences | Formal science  
Natural science | Social science  
Basic | Physics, chemistry, biology, earth science, and space science |
Anthropology, economics, political science, human geography, psychology, and
sociology | Logic, mathematics, and statistics  
Applied | Engineering, agricultural science, medicine, and materials science |
Business administration, public policy, marketing, law, pedagogy, and
international development | Computer science  
  
### Natural science

Further information: Natural science and Outline of natural science

Natural science is the study of the physical world. It can be divided into two
main branches:  life science (or biological science) and  physical science.
These two branches may be further divided into more specialized disciplines.
For example, physical science can be subdivided into physics, chemistry,
astronomy, and earth science. Modern natural science is the successor to the
natural philosophy that began in Ancient Greece. Galileo, Descartes, Bacon,
and Newton debated the benefits of using approaches which were more
mathematical and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical
perspectives, conjectures, and presuppositions, often overlooked, remain
necessary in natural science.[112] Systematic data collection, including
discovery science, succeeded natural history, which emerged in the 16th
century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so
on.[113] Today, "natural history" suggests observational descriptions aimed at
popular audiences.[114]

### Social science

Further information: Social science and Outline of social science

In economics, the supply and demand model describes how prices vary in a
market economy as a result of a balance between product availability and
consumer demand.

Social science is the study of human behavior and functioning of
societies.[20][21] It has many disciplines that include, but are not limited
to anthropology, economics, history, human geography, political science,
psychology, and sociology.[20] In the social sciences, there are many
competing theoretical perspectives, many of which are extended through
competing research programs such as the  functionalists,  conflict theorists,
and  interactionists in sociology.[20] Due to the limitations of conducting
controlled experiments involving large groups of individuals or complex
situations, social scientists may adopt other research methods such as the
historical method,  case studies, and cross-cultural studies. Moreover, if
quantitative information is available, social scientists may rely on
statistical approaches to better understand social relationships and
processes.[20]

### Formal science

Further information: Formal science and Outline of formal science

Formal science is an area of study that generates knowledge using formal
systems.[115][22][23] It includes mathematics,[116][117] systems theory, and
theoretical computer science. The formal sciences share similarities with the
other two branches by relying on objective, careful, and systematic study of
an area of knowledge. They are, however, different from the empirical sciences
as they rely exclusively on deductive reasoning, without the need for
empirical evidence, to verify their abstract concepts.[27][118][111] The
formal sciences are therefore _a priori_ disciplines and because of this,
there is disagreement on whether they actually constitute a science.[24][26]
Nevertheless, the formal sciences play an important role in the empirical
sciences. Calculus, for example, was initially invented to understand motion
in physics.[119] Natural and social sciences that rely heavily on mathematical
applications include mathematical physics, mathematical chemistry,
mathematical biology, mathematical finance, and mathematical economics.

### Applied science

Further information: Applied science and Outline of applied science

Louis Pasteur's pasteurization experiment illustrates that the spoilage of
liquid is caused by particles in the air rather than the liquid itself.
Pasteur also discovered the principles of vaccination and fermentation.

Applied science is the use of the scientific method and knowledge to attain
practical goals and includes a broad range of disciplines such as engineering
and medicine.[28][29][30][31][32] Engineering is the use of scientific
principles to design and build machines, structures, and other items,
including bridges, tunnels, roads, vehicles, and buildings.[120] Engineering
itself encompasses a range of more specialized fields of engineering, each
with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics,
science, and types of application. Medicine is the practice of caring for
patients by maintaining and restoring health through the prevention,
diagnosis, and treatment of injury or disease.[121][122][123][124]
Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, medical research, genetics,
and medical technology to prevent, diagnose, and treat injury and disease,
typically through the use of medications, medical devices, surgery, and non-
pharmacological interventions. The applied sciences are often contrasted with
the basic sciences, which are focused on advancing scientific theories and
laws that explain and predict events in the natural world.

## Scientific research

Further information: Research

Scientific research can be labeled as either basic or applied research. Basic
research is the search for knowledge and applied research is the search for
solutions to practical problems using this knowledge. Although some scientific
research is applied research into specific problems, a great deal of our
understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of basic research.
This leads to options for technological advances that were not planned or
sometimes even imaginable. This point was made by Michael Faraday when
allegedly in response to the question "what is the _use_ of basic research?"
he responded: "Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?".[125] For example,
research into the effects of red light on the human eye's rod cells did not
seem to have any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our night
vision is not troubled by red light would lead search and rescue teams (among
others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters.[126]
Finally, even basic research can take unexpected turns, and there is some
sense in which the scientific method is built to harness luck.

### Scientific method

Further information: Scientific method

The scientific method originated with Aristotle's idea that knowledge came
from careful observation, and was brought into modern form by Galileo's
collection of empirical evidence.[127]

Scientific research involves using the scientific method, which seeks to
objectively explain the events of nature in a reproducible way.[128] An
explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis is put forward as explanation
using principles such as parsimony (also known as "Occam's Razor") and are
generally expected to seek consilience – fitting well with other accepted
facts related to the phenomena.[129] This new explanation is used to make
falsifiable predictions that are testable by experiment or observation. The
predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is
sought, as proof that no tampering has occurred. Disproof of a prediction is
evidence of progress.[lower-alpha 5][lower-alpha 6][128][130] This is done
partly through observation of natural phenomena, but also through
experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled
conditions as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences,
such as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might take the place of
a controlled experiment). Experimentation is especially important in science
to help establish causal relationships (to avoid the correlation fallacy).

When a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory, it is either modified or
discarded.[131] If the hypothesis survived testing, it may become adopted into
the framework of a scientific theory, a logically reasoned, self-consistent
model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena. A
theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than
a hypothesis; commonly, a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound
together by a single theory. Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various
other hypotheses. In that vein, theories are formulated according to most of
the same scientific principles as hypotheses. In addition to testing
hypotheses, scientists may also generate a model, an attempt to describe or
depict the phenomenon in terms of a logical, physical or mathematical
representation and to generate new hypotheses that can be tested, based on
observable phenomena.[132]

While performing experiments to test hypotheses, scientists may have a
preference for one outcome over another, and so it is important to ensure that
science as a whole can eliminate this bias.[133][134] This can be achieved by
careful experimental design, transparency, and a thorough peer review process
of the experimental results as well as any conclusions.[135][136] After the
results of an experiment are announced or published, it is normal practice for
independent researchers to double-check how the research was performed, and to
follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the
results might be.[137] Taken in its entirety, the scientific method allows for
highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective
bias on the part of its users (especially the confirmation bias).[138]

#### Verifiability

John Ziman points out that intersubjective verifiability is fundamental to the
creation of all scientific knowledge.[139] Ziman shows how scientists can
identify patterns to each other across centuries; he refers to this ability as
"perceptual consensibility."[139] He then makes consensibility, leading to
consensus, the touchstone of reliable knowledge.[140]

### Role of mathematics

Further information: Mathematics and Formal science

Calculus, the mathematics of continuous change, underpins many of the
sciences.

Mathematics is essential in the formation of hypotheses, theories, and
laws[141] in the natural and social sciences. For example, it is used in
quantitative scientific modeling, which can generate new hypotheses and
predictions to be tested. It is also used extensively in observing and
collecting measurements. Statistics, a branch of mathematics, is used to
summarize and analyze data, which allow scientists to assess the reliability
and variability of their experimental results.

Computational science applies computing power to simulate real-world
situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal
mathematics alone can achieve. According to the Society for Industrial and
Applied Mathematics, computation is now as important as theory and experiment
in advancing scientific knowledge.[142]

### Philosophy of science

Further information: Philosophy of science

Scientists usually take for granted a set of basic assumptions that are needed
to justify the scientific method: (1) that there is an objective reality
shared by all rational observers; (2) that this objective reality is governed
by natural laws; (3) that these laws can be discovered by means of systematic
observation and experimentation.[3] The philosophy of science seeks a deep
understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are
valid.

The belief that scientific theories should and do represent metaphysical
reality is known as realism. It can be contrasted with anti-realism, the view
that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about
unobservable entities such as electrons. One form of anti-realism is idealism,
the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence, and that
each mind generates its own reality.[lower-alpha 7] In an idealistic world
view, what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds.

There are different schools of thought in the philosophy of science. The most
popular position is empiricism,[lower-alpha 8] which holds that knowledge is
created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are
the result of generalizations from such observations.[143] Empiricism
generally encompasses inductivism, a position that tries to explain the way
general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans
can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to
confirm scientific theories. This is necessary because the number of
predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be
known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive logic only. Many
versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being Bayesianism[144]
and the hypothetico-deductive method.[143]

_The Horse in Motion_ (1878) falsifies the _flying gallop_. Karl Popper, best
known for his work on empirical falsification, proposed replacing
verifiability with conjecture and refutation as the landmark of scientific
theories.

Empiricism has stood in contrast to rationalism, the position originally
associated with Descartes, which holds that knowledge is created by the human
intellect, not by observation.[145] Critical rationalism is a contrasting
20th-century approach to science, first defined by Austrian-British
philosopher Karl Popper. Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the
connection between theory and observation. He claimed that theories are not
generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of
theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when
it comes in conflict with it.[146] Popper proposed replacing verifiability
with falsifiability as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing
induction with falsification as the empirical method.[146] Popper further
claimed that there is actually only one universal method, not specific to
science: the negative method of criticism, trial and error.[147] It covers all
products of the human mind, including science, mathematics, philosophy, and
art.[148]

Another approach, instrumentalism, emphasizes the utility of theories as
instruments for explaining and predicting phenomena.[149] It views scientific
theories as black boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output
(predictions) being relevant. Consequences, theoretical entities, and logical
structure are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that
scientists should not make a fuss about (see interpretations of quantum
mechanics). Close to instrumentalism is constructive empiricism, according to
which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether
what it says about observable entities is true.

For Kuhn, the addition of epicycles in Ptolemaic astronomy was "normal
science" within a paradigm, whereas the Copernican revolution was a paradigm
shift.

Thomas Kuhn argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place
within a paradigm, a logically consistent "portrait" of the world that is
consistent with observations made from its framing. He characterized _normal
science_ as the process of observation and "puzzle solving" which takes place
within a paradigm, whereas _revolutionary science_ occurs when one paradigm
overtakes another in a paradigm shift.[150] Each paradigm has its own distinct
questions, aims, and interpretations. The choice between paradigms involves
setting two or more "portraits" against the world and deciding which likeness
is most promising. A paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of
observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes
sense of them. That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations,
even though those observations are made against the background of the old
paradigm. For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process
as much as a logical process. Kuhn's position, however, is not one of
relativism.[151]

Finally, another approach often cited in debates of scientific skepticism
against controversial movements like "creation science" is methodological
naturalism. Its main point is that a difference between natural and
supernatural explanations should be made and that science should be restricted
methodologically to natural explanations.[152][lower-alpha 9] That the
restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that
science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not
claim them to be wrong either. Instead, supernatural explanations should be
left a matter of personal belief outside the scope of science. Methodological
naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to
empirical study and independent verification as a process for properly
developing and evaluating explanations for observable phenomena.[153] The
absence of these standards, arguments from authority, biased observational
studies and other common fallacies are frequently cited by supporters of
methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non-science they criticize.

#### Certainty and science

A scientific theory is empirical[lower-alpha 8][154] and is always open to
falsification if new evidence is presented. That is, no theory is ever
considered strictly certain as science accepts the concept of
fallibilism.[lower-alpha 10] The philosopher of science Karl Popper sharply
distinguished truth from certainty. He wrote that scientific knowledge
"consists in the search for truth," but it "is not the search for certainty
... All human knowledge is fallible and therefore uncertain."[155]

New scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding.
According to psychologist Keith Stanovich, it may be the media's overuse of
words like "breakthrough" that leads the public to imagine that science is
constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false.[126] While
there are such famous cases as the theory of relativity that required a
complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions. Knowledge in
science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different
experiments by various researchers across different branches of science; it is
more like a climb than a leap.[126] Theories vary in the extent to which they
have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific
community.[lower-alpha 11] For example, heliocentric theory, the theory of
evolution, relativity theory, and germ theory still bear the name "theory"
even though, in practice, they are considered factual.[156] Philosopher Barry
Stroud adds that, although the best definition for "knowledge" is contested,
being skeptical and entertaining the _possibility_ that one is incorrect is
compatible with being correct. Therefore, scientists adhering to proper
scientific approaches will doubt themselves even once they possess the
truth.[157] The fallibilist C. S. Peirce argued that inquiry is the struggle
to resolve actual doubt and that merely quarrelsome, verbal, or hyperbolic
doubt is fruitless[158] – but also that the inquirer should try to attain
genuine doubt rather than resting uncritically on common sense.[159] He held
that the successful sciences trust not to any single chain of inference (no
stronger than its weakest link) but to the cable of multiple and various
arguments intimately connected.[160]

Stanovich also asserts that science avoids searching for a "magic bullet"; it
avoids the single-cause fallacy. This means a scientist would not ask merely
"What is _the_ cause of ...", but rather "What _are_ the most significant
_causes_ of ...". This is especially the case in the more macroscopic fields
of science (e.g. psychology, physical cosmology).[126] Research often analyzes
few factors at once, but these are always added to the long list of factors
that are most important to consider.[126] For example, knowing the details of
only a person's genetics, or their history and upbringing, or the current
situation may not explain a behavior, but a deep understanding of all these
variables combined can be very predictive.

### Scientific literature

Further information: Scientific literature

Cover of the first volume of the scientific journal _Science_ in 1880

Scientific research is published in an enormous range of scientific
literature.[161] Scientific journals communicate and document the results of
research carried out in universities and various other research institutions,
serving as an archival record of science. The first scientific journals,
_Journal des Sçavans_ followed by the _Philosophical Transactions_ , began
publication in 1665. Since that time the total number of active periodicals
has steadily increased. In 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific and
technical journals in publication was 11,500.[162] The United States National
Library of Medicine currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on
topics related to the life sciences. Although the journals are in 39
languages, 91 percent of the indexed articles are published in English.[163]

Most scientific journals cover a single scientific field and publish the
research within that field; the research is normally expressed in the form of
a scientific paper. Science has become so pervasive in modern societies that
it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements, news,
and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace.

Science magazines such as _New Scientist_ , _Science& Vie_, and _Scientific
American_ cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-
technical summary of popular areas of research, including notable discoveries
and advances in certain fields of research. Science books engage the interest
of many more people. Tangentially, the science fiction genre, primarily
fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas,
if not the methods, of science.

Recent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non-
scientific disciplines such as literature or more specifically, poetry,
include the _Creative Writing Science_ resource developed through the Royal
Literary Fund.[164]

### Practical impacts

Discoveries in fundamental science can be world-changing. For example:

     Research| Impact  
---|---  
Static electricity and magnetism (c. 1600)  
Electric current (18th century)| All electric appliances, dynamos, electric
power stations, modern electronics, including electric lighting, television,
electric heating, transcranial magnetic stimulation, deep brain stimulation,
magnetic tape, loudspeaker, and the compass and lightning rod.  
Diffraction (1665)| Optics, hence fiber optic cable (1840s), modern
intercontinental communications, and cable TV and internet.  
Germ theory (1700)| Hygiene, leading to decreased transmission of infectious
diseases; antibodies, leading to techniques for disease diagnosis and targeted
anticancer therapies.  
Vaccination (1798)| Leading to the elimination of most infectious diseases
from developed countries and the worldwide eradication of smallpox.  
Photovoltaic effect (1839)| Solar cells (1883), hence solar power, solar
powered watches, calculators and other devices.  
The strange orbit of Mercury (1859) and other research  
leading to special (1905) and general relativity (1916)| Satellite-based
technology such as GPS (1973), satnav and satellite communications.[lower-
alpha 12]  
Radio waves (1887)| Radio had become used in innumerable ways beyond its
better-known areas of telephony, and broadcast television (1927) and radio
(1906) entertainment. Other uses included – emergency services, radar
(navigation and weather prediction), medicine, astronomy, wireless
communications, geophysics, and networking. Radio waves also led researchers
to adjacent frequencies such as microwaves, used worldwide for heating and
cooking food.  
Radioactivity (1896) and antimatter (1932)| Cancer treatment (1896),
Radiometric dating (1905), nuclear reactors (1942) and weapons (1945), mineral
exploration, PET scans (1961), and medical research (via isotopic labeling).  
X-rays (1896)| Medical imaging, including computed tomography.  
Crystallography and quantum mechanics (1900)| Semiconductor devices (1906),
hence modern computing and telecommunications including the integration with
wireless devices: the mobile phone,[lower-alpha 12] LED lamps and lasers.  
Plastics (1907)| Starting with Bakelite, many types of artificial polymers for
numerous applications in industry and daily life.  
Antibiotics (1880s, 1928)| Salvarsan, Penicillin, doxycycline, etc.  
Nuclear magnetic resonance (1930s)| Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy
(1946), magnetic resonance imaging (1971), functional magnetic resonance
imaging (1990s).  
  
### Challenges

#### Replication crisis

Further information: Replication crisis and Metascience

The replication crisis is an ongoing methodological crisis primarily affecting
parts of the social and life sciences in which scholars have found that the
results of many scientific studies are difficult or impossible to replicate or
reproduce on subsequent investigation, either by independent researchers or by
the original researchers themselves.[165][166] The crisis has long-standing
roots; the phrase was coined in the early 2010s[167] as part of a growing
awareness of the problem. The replication crisis represents an important body
of research in metascience, which aims to improve the quality of all
scientific research while reducing waste.[168]

#### Fringe science, pseudoscience, and junk science

An area of study or speculation that masquerades as science in an attempt to
claim a legitimacy that it would not otherwise be able to achieve is sometimes
referred to as pseudoscience, fringe science, or junk science.[lower-alpha 13]
Physicist Richard Feynman coined the term "cargo cult science" for cases in
which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have
the outward appearance of science but actually lack the "kind of utter
honesty" that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated.[169] Various
types of commercial advertising, ranging from hype to fraud, may fall into
these categories. Science has been described as "the most important tool" for
separating valid claims from invalid ones.[170]

There can also be an element of political or ideological bias on all sides of
scientific debates. Sometimes, research may be characterized as "bad science,"
research that may be well-intended but is actually incorrect, obsolete,
incomplete, or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas. The term
"scientific misconduct" refers to situations such as where researchers have
intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given
credit for a discovery to the wrong person.[171]

## Scientific community

Further information: Scientific community

The scientific community is a group of all interacting scientists, along with
their respective societies and institutions.

### Scientists

Further information: Scientist

German-born scientist Albert Einstein (1879–1955) developed the theory of
relativity. He also won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921 for his explanation
of the photoelectric effect.

Scientists are individuals who conduct scientific research to advance
knowledge in an area of interest.[172][173] The term _scientist_ was coined by
William Whewell in 1833. In modern times, many professional scientists are
trained in an academic setting and upon completion, attain an academic degree,
with the highest degree being a doctorate such as a Doctor of Philosophy
(PhD).[174] Many scientists pursue careers in various sectors of the economy
such as academia, industry, government, and nonprofit
organizations.[175][176][177]

Scientists exhibit a strong curiosity about reality, with some scientists
having a desire to apply scientific knowledge for the benefit of health,
nations, environment, or industries. Other motivations include recognition by
their peers and prestige. The Nobel Prize, a widely regarded prestigious
award,[178] is awarded annually to those who have achieved scientific advances
in the fields of medicine, physics, chemistry, and economics.

#### Women in science

Further information: Women in science and Women in STEM fields

Marie Curie was the first person to be awarded two Nobel Prizes: Physics in
1903 and Chemistry in 1911.[179]

Science has historically been a male-dominated field, with some notable
exceptions.[lower-alpha 14] Women faced considerable discrimination in
science, much as they did in other areas of male-dominated societies, such as
frequently being passed over for job opportunities and denied credit for their
work.[lower-alpha 15] For example, Christine Ladd (1847–1930) was able to
enter a Ph.D. program as "C. Ladd"; Christine "Kitty" Ladd completed the
requirements in 1882, but was awarded her degree only in 1926, after a career
which spanned the algebra of logic (see truth table), color vision, and
psychology. Her work preceded notable researchers like Ludwig Wittgenstein and
Charles Sanders Peirce. The achievements of women in science have been
attributed to the defiance of their traditional role as laborers within the
domestic sphere.[180]

In the late 20th century, active recruitment of women and elimination of
institutional discrimination on the basis of sex greatly increased the number
of women scientists, but large gender disparities remain in some fields; in
the early 21st century over half of the new biologists were female, while 80%
of PhDs in physics are given to men.[ _citation needed_ ] In the early part of
the 21st century, women in the United States earned 50.3% of bachelor's
degrees, 45.6% of master's degrees, and 40.7% of PhDs in science and
engineering fields. They earned more than half of the degrees in psychology
(about 70%), social sciences (about 50%), and biology (about 50–60%) but
earned less than half the degrees in the physical sciences, earth sciences,
mathematics, engineering, and computer science.[181] Lifestyle choice also
plays a major role in female engagement in science; women with young children
are 28% less likely to take tenure-track positions due to work-life balance
issues,[182] and female graduate students' interest in careers in research
declines dramatically over the course of graduate school, whereas that of
their male colleagues remains unchanged.[183]

### Learned societies

Further information: Learned society

Physicists in front of the Royal Society building in London (1952)

Learned societies for the communication and promotion of scientific thought
and experimentation have existed since the Renaissance.[184] Many scientists
belong to a learned society that promotes their respective scientific
discipline, profession, or group of related disciplines.[185] Membership may
be open to all, may require possession of some scientific credentials, or may
be an honor conferred by election.[186] Most scientific societies are non-
profit organizations, and many are professional associations. Their activities
typically include holding regular conferences for the presentation and
discussion of new research results and publishing or sponsoring academic
journals in their discipline. Some also act as professional bodies, regulating
the activities of their members in the public interest or the collective
interest of the membership. Scholars in the sociology of science[ _who?_ ]
argue that learned societies are of key importance and their formation assists
in the emergence and development of new disciplines or professions.

The professionalization of science, begun in the 19th century, was partly
enabled by the creation of distinguished academy of sciences in a number of
countries such as the Italian _Accademia dei Lincei_ in 1603,[187] the British
Royal Society in 1660, the French _Académie des Sciences_ in 1666,[188] the
American National Academy of Sciences in 1863, the German Kaiser Wilhelm
Institute in 1911, and the Chinese Academy of Sciences in 1928. International
scientific organizations, such as the International Council for Science, have
since been formed to promote cooperation between the scientific communities of
different nations.

### Science policy

Further information: Science policy, History of science policy, and Economics
of science

The United Nations _Global Science-Policy-Business Forum on the Environment_
in Nairobi, Kenya (2017)

Science policy is an area of public policy concerned with the policies that
affect the conduct of the scientific enterprise, including research funding,
often in pursuance of other national policy goals such as technological
innovation to promote commercial product development, weapons development,
health care, and environmental monitoring. Science policy also refers to the
act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of
public policies. Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues
that involve the natural sciences. In accordance with public policy being
concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to
consider how science and technology can best serve the public.

State policy has influenced the funding of public works and science for
thousands of years, particularly within civilizations with highly organized
governments such as imperial China and the Roman Empire. Prominent historical
examples include the Great Wall of China, completed over the course of two
millennia through the state support of several dynasties, and the Grand Canal
of the Yangtze River, an immense feat of hydraulic engineering begun by Sunshu
Ao (孫叔敖 7th c. BCE), Ximen Bao (西門豹 5th c.BCE), and Shi Chi (4th c. BCE). This
construction dates from the 6th century BCE under the Sui Dynasty and is still
in use today. In China, such state-supported infrastructure and scientific
research projects date at least from the time of the Mohists, who inspired the
study of logic during the period of the Hundred Schools of Thought and the
study of defensive fortifications like the Great Wall of China during the
Warring States period.

Public policy can directly affect the funding of capital equipment and
intellectual infrastructure for industrial research by providing tax
incentives to those organizations that fund research. Vannevar Bush, director
of the Office of Scientific Research and Development for the United States
government, the forerunner of the National Science Foundation, wrote in July
1945 that "Science is a proper concern of government."[189]

#### Funding of science

Further information: Funding of science

The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) Main
Entomology Building in Australia

Scientific research is often funded through a competitive process in which
potential research projects are evaluated and only the most promising receive
funding. Such processes, which are run by government, corporations, or
foundations, allocate scarce funds. Total research funding in most developed
countries is between 1.5% and 3% of GDP.[190] In the OECD, around two-thirds
of research and development in scientific and technical fields is carried out
by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively by universities and government. The
government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it
dominates research in social science and humanities. Similarly, with some
exceptions (e.g. biotechnology) government provides the bulk of the funds for
basic scientific research. Many governments have dedicated agencies to support
scientific research. Prominent scientific organizations include the National
Science Foundation in the United States, the National Scientific and Technical
Research Council in Argentina, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia, _Centre national de la recherche
scientifique_ in France, the Max Planck Society and _Deutsche
Forschungsgemeinschaft_ in Germany, and CSIC in Spain. In commercial research
and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more
heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities rather than "blue-sky"
ideas or technologies (such as nuclear fusion).

### Public awareness of science

Further information: Public awareness of science, Science outreach, and
Science communication

Dinosaur exhibit in the Houston Museum of Natural Science

The public awareness of science relates to the attitudes, behaviors, opinions,
and activities that make up the relations between science and the general
public. It integrates various themes and activities such as science
communication, science museums, science festivals, science fairs, citizen
science, and science in popular culture. Social scientists have devised
various metrics to measure the public understanding of science such as factual
knowledge, self-reported knowledge, and structural knowledge.[191][192]

### Science journalism

Further information: Science journalism

The mass media face a number of pressures that can prevent them from
accurately depicting competing scientific claims in terms of their credibility
within the scientific community as a whole. Determining how much weight to
give different sides in a scientific debate may require considerable expertise
regarding the matter.[193] Few journalists have real scientific knowledge, and
even beat reporters who know a great deal about certain scientific issues may
be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to
cover.[194][195]

### Politicization of science

Further information: Politicization of science

Academic studies of scientific agreement on human-caused global warming among
climate experts (2010-2015) reflect that the level of consensus correlates
with expertise in climate science.[196] A 2019 study found scientific
consensus to be at 100%.[197] Results stand in contrast to the political
controversy over this issue, particularly in the United States.

Politicization of science occurs when government, business, or advocacy groups
use legal or economic pressure to influence the findings of scientific
research or the way it is disseminated, reported, or interpreted. Many factors
can act as facets of the politicization of science such as populist anti-
intellectualism, perceived threats to religious beliefs, postmodernist
subjectivism, and fear for business interests.[198] Politicization of science
is usually accomplished when scientific information is presented in a way that
emphasizes the uncertainty associated with the scientific evidence.[199]
Tactics such as shifting conversation, failing to acknowledge facts, and
capitalizing on doubt of scientific consensus have been used to gain more
attention for views that have been undermined by scientific evidence.[200]
Examples of issues that have involved the politicization of science include
the global warming controversy, health effects of pesticides, and health
effects of tobacco.[200][201]

  3. ↑  The translator, Gerard of Cremona (c. 1114–1187), inspired by his love of the Almagest, came to Toledo, where he knew he could find the Almagest in Arabic. There he found Arabic books of every description, and learned Arabic in order to translate these books into Latin, being aware of 'the poverty of the Latins'. —As cited by Burnett, Charles (2002). "The Coherence of the Arabic-Latin Translation Program in Toledo in the Twelfth Century" (PDF). _Science in Context_. **14** (1–2): 249–88. doi:10.1017/S0269889701000096. S2CID 143006568.

    * The full title translation is from p. 60 of James R. Voelkel (2001) _Johannes Kepler and the New Astronomy_ Oxford University Press. Kepler was driven to this experiment after observing the partial solar eclipse at Graz, July 10, 1600. He used Tycho Brahe's method of observation, which was to project the image of the Sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture, instead of looking directly at the Sun. He disagreed with Brahe's conclusion that total eclipses of the Sun were impossible because there were historical accounts of total eclipses. Instead, he deduced that the size of the aperture controls the sharpness of the projected image (the larger the aperture, the more accurate the image – this fact is now fundamental for optical system design). Voelkel, p. 61, notes that Kepler's experiments produced the first correct account of vision and the eye because he realized he could not accurately write about astronomical observation by ignoring the eye.
  5. ↑  di Francia 1976, pp. 4–5: "One learns in a laboratory; one learns how to make experiments only by experimenting, and one learns how to work with his hands only by using them. The first and fundamental form of experimentation in physics is to teach young people to work with their hands. Then they should be taken into a laboratory and taught to work with measuring instruments – each student carrying out real experiments in physics. This form of teaching is indispensable and cannot be read in a book."
  6. ↑  Fara 2009, p. 204: "Whatever their discipline, scientists claimed to share a common scientific method that ... distinguished them from non-scientists."
  7. ↑  This realization is the topic of intersubjective verifiability, as recounted, for example, by Max Born (1949, 1965) _Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance_, who points out that all knowledge, including natural or social science, is also subjective. p. 162: "Thus it dawned upon me that fundamentally everything is subjective, everything without exception. That was a shock."
  8. 1 2  In his investigation of the law of falling bodies, Galileo (1638) serves as an example for scientific investigation: _Two New Sciences_ "A piece of wooden moulding or scantling, about 12 cubits long, half a cubit wide, and three finger-breadths thick, was taken; on its edge was cut a channel a little more than one finger in breadth; having made this groove very straight, smooth, and polished, and having lined it with parchment, also as smooth and polished as possible, we rolled along it a hard, smooth, and very round bronze ball. Having placed this board in a sloping position, by lifting one end some one or two cubits above the other, we rolled the ball, as I was just saying, along the channel, noting, in a manner presently to be described, the time required to make the descent. We ... now rolled the ball only one-quarter the length of the channel; and having measured the time of its descent, we found it precisely one-half of the former. Next, we tried other distances, comparing the time for the whole length with that for the half, or with that for two-thirds, or three-fourths, or indeed for any fraction; in such experiments, repeated many, many, times." Galileo solved the problem of time measurement by weighing a jet of water collected during the descent of the bronze ball, as stated in his _Two New Sciences_.

The Stanford article states: "Many writers on pseudoscience have emphasized that pseudoscience is non-science posing as science. The foremost modern classic on the subject (Gardner 1957) bears the title Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science. According to Brian Baigrie (1988, 438), "[w]hat is objectionable about these beliefs is that they masquerade as genuinely scientific ones." These and many other authors assume that to be pseudoscientific, an activity or a teaching has to satisfy the following two criteria (Hansson 1996): (1) it is not scientific, and (2) its major proponents try to create the impression that it is scientific".

"The changing character of those engaged in scientific endeavors was matched by a new nomenclature for their endeavors. The most conspicuous marker of this change was the replacement of "natural philosophy" by "natural science". In 1800 few had spoken of the "natural sciences" but by 1880, this expression had overtaken the traditional label "natural philosophy". The persistence of "natural philosophy" in the twentieth century is owing largely to historical references to a past practice (see figure 11). As should now be apparent, this was not simply the substitution of one term by another, but involved the jettisoning of a range of personal qualities relating to the conduct of philosophy and the living of the philosophical life."
